## Key Concepts

To be able to work with parties, you will need to understand these key concepts:

- Party State is used to manage parties through a structured lifecycle and manage your relationship and associated risk with them. This is more relevant when you choose the on-platform model. If you choose off-platform, the state is only managed as part of the party creation process; any state-management post-provisioning should be handled client-side. You can read more in our key concepts section [parties](/get-started/core_concepts/parties). 
- Party Role; your use-case may mean that you have multiple parties associated with a single subscription. You can assign roles to parties with corresponding permissions. For example, in business banking, customers may choose to invite their accountant to access their account and view the associated payments. Party roles make this possible.
